### Javascript crash course

> This is not a graded assignment, but if you're rusty or new to Javascript, you should work through these fundamentals. Upcoming class exercises and assignments will take this knowledge for granted.

Javascript is a critical skill for building news applications, as it's the base language for adding interactivity to web pages and building dynamic, data-driven visualizations. You don't need to master JS to begin using the language. But it's a good idea to gain some ambient awareness of core JS language features so you have a sense of what's possible and where to refresh on syntax as you begin coding real-world projects. The goal is to begin laying a foundation of Javascript knowledge that you can incrementally refine and expand, rather than copy/pasting code dug up from the Internet.

A good place to begin learning (or brushing up on) Javascript is the [W3C Javascript tutorial][]. To gain the best overall sense of Javascript's features, I'd encourage you to read and work through the code examples in the introductory section (`JS Home` through `JS Mistakes`). Warning: this is a LOT of work.

For those crunched on time, at least skim through the below sections. We'll spend time reinforcing these fundamentals through class exercises and homework assignments.

* [JS HOME][] through [JS Objects][]
* [JS Strings][] and [JS String methods][]
* [JS Arrays][], [array methods][], [array iteration][]
* [`for` loops][]
* [Comparisons][]
* [Conditional statements][]

Some key skills you'll be expected to be familiar with:

* Embedding JS code in an HTML page and using an external JS file
* How to output variables in the console of the browser developer toolbar
* Working with strings, numbers, objects and arrays
* Creating and using functions
* Looping and conditional statements

The above represents a solid subset of language features and skills that should help you begin reading and writing Javascript.

#### Other resources

If you prefer a more human-friendly (though verbose) introduction, you might also want to check out [Learn Enough Javascript to Be Dangerous][]. To get started, just work through `Section 5.4 - Iteration for each`, focusing exclusively on the use of JS examples in a browser.

Lastly, this [JS cheatsheet][] is also quite handy.
