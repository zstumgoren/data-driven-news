<p>I'm happy to meet during or outside of normally scheduled office hours. Please come by if you have questions about the coursework or generally want to 
discuss story ideas, data journalism or other topics. 
We can also chat by phone or video when I'm working off-campus (Mondays and Fridays) -- 
just reach out via email to schedule a time.
