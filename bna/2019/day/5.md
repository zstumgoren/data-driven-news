## Website Design Review

Today we'll review the results of our collaborative web design process (assignment 5). This will include:

* Presenting images of your design sketches
* Showing us your [Github project board][]
* Sharing the feedback received during the collaborative design review process
* Explaining what, if any, changes you made as a result of the feedback

After presentations, we'll begin implementing our designs as part of Project 1.
