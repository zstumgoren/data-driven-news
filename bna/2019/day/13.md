## Overview

Today we'll have a guest lecture by [John Keefe](https://johnkeefe.net/more-about-me) from the [Quartz AI Studio](https://qz.ai/). John has a wealth of experience in some of the more innovative areas of data journalism, including sensor journalism and the application of AI and machine-learning to help tell stories. A few examples of his work:

* [Harlem Heat Sensors](https://www.wnyc.org/story/harlem-heat-project-launch)
* [Cicadas](https://project.wnyc.org/cicadas/)
* [Quackbot](https://bots.qz.com/1455/announcing-quackbot-a-slack-bot-for-journalists-from-quartz-and-documentcloud/)

He also has some wise advice on [learning new things](http://johnkeefe.net/beginning-as-a-practice).

## Assignment 10

> Ungraded assignment, due by class on Thursday May 16th.

On Thursday we'll begin ramping up on D3 to build interactive visualizations. To ensure we hit the ground running, please complete the following:

* Read and work through the W3C [CSS transforms][] docs and exercises.
* Read following sections from the [D3.js Quick Start Guide][]:
  * [What is SVG?][]
  * [What makes D3 so special?][]
  * [Using SVG to Create Images Using Code][] - read and work through the code examples

    > Please use Chrome for the exercises in [Using SVG to Create Images Using Code][], since some of the examples may not work in Firefox or other browsers. For example, [FF doesn't support setting a circle's radius via CSS][].
