## Coding Workshop

Today we'll work through [a basic example][] from the [D3.js Quick Start Guide][] that introduces some critical concepts. Along the way, we'll learn how to use the Chrome Developer Toolbar to debug and gain insight into how D3 works.

### D3 Resources

[D3](https://d3js.org/) is a popular Javascript library that provides incredible flexibility for creating interactive visualizations.

With this flexibility comes a learning curve. Below are a few resources intended to help level up on core features, work through coding challenges, and inspire visualization ideas.

* [D3 Gallery][] - The official (huge) collection of D3 visualization examples with code samples. Check here for inspiration on the possibilities with D3.
* [D3 Graph Gallery][] - A gallery of simpler D3 examples curated by the folks behind [From Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/).
* [D3.js Quick Start Guide][] - A collection of D3 examples that cover a variety of core use cases, including force-directed graphs and mapping.
* [Data Visualization with D3 Cookbook][] - Lots of technical detail on core D3 features and sample code for charts and maps.

### Data joins and updates

A key concept at the heart of D3 is the *enter-update-exit* pattern, which provides the mechanism for binding data to graphical representations and manipulating the connections between the two domains. As D3 creator Mike Bostock puts it in [Thinking with Joins][]:

> *Hereâ€™s the deal. Instead of telling D3 how to do something, tell D3 what you want. You want the circle elements to correspond to data. You want one circle per datum. Instead of instructing D3 to create circles, then, tell D3 that the selection "circle" should correspond to data. This concept is called the data join...*


This concept (and the related syntax) can be hard to grasp because it's quite different from other programming paradigms. To simplify things, the D3 creator recently added [selection.join][]. But it's important to familiarize ourselves with the pattern to gain a foundational grasp of D3, and because so much example code and documentation relies on it. Here are a few resources that may help illuminate the topic:

* [Thinking with Joins][]- A short but handy window into the thinking behind data joins and why they're important, by the creator of D3. It's worth checking out the related code demo in [General Update Pattern, I][].
* [Enter and Exit][] - Official D3 intro to the topic (it's quite terse).
* [Enter, Update, Exit][] - A short Medium post that introduces the pattern in plain and relatively simple language
* [the enter-update-exit pattern][] - A more lengthy and technical write-up on how "data joins" match data to visual representations and expose ways to manage the connection between the two.
