## Quakebot review

We'll review solutions to the [quakebot assignment](https://github.com/zstumgoren/quakebot-exercise), which involved writing a Jinja template to generate an automated story from USGS earthquake data.

## The Coding Cockpit

![cockpit](/img/nasa-cockpit.jpg)

To the untrained eye, a cockpit dashboard is a nonsensical array of guages and dials. To a pilot, the dashboard is a vital window into the surrounding environment and status of a hurtling tube of metal.

Yes, programming is a far less risky endeavor, but we too we need visibility into the workings of the machine. Otherwise we're just pushing buttons and turning dials without understanding their effects.

When coding for the web, the browser's [developer toolbar][] is your cockpit dashboard. It provides a window into how the code is - or is not - working. It lets you view the effects of changes, expose and debug errors, and experiment with different solutions.

If you're new to a language or technique (e.g. events in Javascript), it may require research to figure out one or more ways to gain visibility into the code. You might use `console.log` in Javascript, or a [Python debugger][] in a web scraper. The tools and strategies will vary by context, but the overarching question remains the same: How do you get visibility into what's happening in the code? 

Discovering and mastering these tools is *as important as learning the syntax of a language.* In fact, these tools can help in the process of learning a language.

## JS Exercises with Dev Tools

Let's begin ramping up on Javascript by working through some [basic exercises][], learning about features of the [developer toolbar][] along the way.
