Today, before forming into groups for team project work, we chatted briefly about the importance of pre-processing data for charts and application features. Transforming CSVs and other data sources into an optimal form for client-side code (i.e. your graphics and apps) is a standard procedure aimed at improving the performance of your front-end code.

But before crafting  your JSON, be sure to have a clear design for visuals and features, and the data required to support those features. Let those designs drive the structure of the underlying data assets (i.e. JSON).  A clear vision for your features will help you contain scope (i.e. avoid unnecessary work), maximize the speed/responsiveness of  your application or charts, and minimize code complexity on the client-side.
