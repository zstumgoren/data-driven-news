## Final presentations

Today we'll present the final versions of our projects. Presentations
should include the following elements:

* Refresher on the goals of your project
* A demo of the app or graphic, highlighting important story elements
  and interactive features
* Discuss the biggest challenges your team encountered and how you
worked through them.
* If you had another month, what else would you have added to the
project?

## Course retrospective

We'll wrap up by reflecting on what you all have accomplished this quarter,
and share ideas for improving the course.
