## Guest lecture

Today, Dilcia Mercedes, a Stanford alumna and current member of the Big Local News project, will share some strategies for [learning and finding help][] that she's picked up on her journey as a programmer.

Following the guest lecture, we'll take a few minutes to crowdsource some of our own favorite resources.

If time allows, we'll also walk through the process of creating a learning plan using GitHub.

## Assignment 4

- Complete your SMART goal.
- Use GitHub to flesh out your personal learning plan.
- Continue working with your group on the team project (again, please use GitHub to plan and assign work).
