In the wake of nationwide protests following the [killing of George Floyd](https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/george-floyd-protests-minneapolis-new-york-los-angeles) in Minneapolis, we'll have talk about efforts by journalists to track the use of force by police. Unfortunately, the federal government does not track this information in a consistent way, so a number of projects have cropped up to fill the gap. 

Here are a few resources and examples we reviewed in class:

* [Police Are Killing Fewer People In Big Cities, But More In Suburban And Rural America](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-are-killing-fewer-people-in-big-cities-but-more-in-suburban-and-rural-america/) by 538
* [Fatal Force](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/) by The Washington Post
* [Fatal Encounters](https://fatalencounters.org/)
* [The Force Report](https://force.nj.com/) by NJ.com
* [Gun Violence Archive](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/)
