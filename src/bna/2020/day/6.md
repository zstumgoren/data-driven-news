Agile teams often block out time to regularly reflect on their process, and to think of ways to improve their team's performance. In the industry slang, these are known as agile "retrospectives". These meetings often occur at the end of a sprint, and are typically structured around three key questions:

* What went well?
* What could we improve?
* What are our next steps/action items?

For each of these questinos, team members take time to post notes on a whiteboard (virtual or real) and then briefly discuss the points raised, before moving onto the next question.

The aim is to externalize successes and areas for potential improvement, and to end the meeting with a concrete plan of action. Just as agile teams build software iteratively, they reflect regularly with the hope of incrementally improving as a team over time.

This process is not so different than an athlete analyzing her techniques, training methods, and other variables that contribute to overall performance. It's not an exercise in self-criticism. It's an attempt to identify ways to achieve peak performace.

Today, we'll do a group retrospective before breaking off into our groups for project work.
