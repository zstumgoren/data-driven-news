Today we'll have group presentations on projects. If you have a demo, that's great -- show us! If you're not quite at the point of a working prototype, be prepared to show us visual designs and explain interactive features that are planned. Also, each team should describe the work that remains, next steps, and potential challenges. This is a chance for each team to get constructive feedback as we make the final push on our projects this quarter.

*Remember: Final project presentations will take place on the last day of class (Tuesday June 2nd)*.
