The [daily stand-up meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting) is used in agile software for brief status check-ins among members of a development team. Participants are expected to speak briefly (no more than 1-2 minutes) and the overall meeting should last no longer than 15 minutes. Standing is important -- even when working remotely -- as a reminder that the meeting should be short. The goal is for teammates to quickly share updates on progress since the last meeting, and to highlight any potential development challenges.

These team member updates should reflect the status of work for the current "sprint" -- i.e. the action items that you've planned out on your GitHub planning board. Some teams hold a separate sprint review meeting where they update the board (creating new tickets, updating existing tickets, closing tickets). But in general, you should strive to update your tickets *before* arriving in stand-up, so that they reflect the current state of affairs.

Each participant should address three key questions as part of the [daily stand-up](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-daily):

- What did I do yesterday that helped the team meet it's sprint goal?
- What will I do today to help the team meet it's sprint goal?
- Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the team from meeting the sprint goal?

When used well, "stand-ups" can help team members synchronize their efforts, identify potential roadblocks early, and even cut down on the need for additional meetings. Stand-ups often get a bad rap, however, because there are pitfalls, especially when participants digress into long technical discussions or veer away from offering constructive information. During stand-up, try to focus purely on what information is actually valuable to your team, and leave the technical conversations for off-line discussions after the meeting.

Note that stand-ups shouldn't replace normal, ongoing communications (e.g. via Slack), especially when a team member discovers information that might require the team to significantly change course on a feature or design decision. 

Agile software development requires communication and collaboration, with short feedback loops. Stand-ups offer a built-in way to ensure daily communication, in addition to other modes of real-time communication that may be more scattered or deeply technical.

## Reference

Here are a few resources on agile methodology that discuss stand-ups (also known as "scrums"). Note that agile methodology can get quite technical, and a whole world of books and blogposts cover the topic. For our class, we'll adopt just a handful of agile practices such as user stories, stand-ups and end-user feedback.

## Assignment 5

- Use GitHub to flesh out your personal learning plan, if you haven't done so already:
  - Complete your SMART goal and add it to a README.md on your GitHub personal learning repo
  - Create a project board on your GitHub personal learning (including a column for `Backlog` items)
  - Create tickets on your GitHub project board for at least 1 week of work, and place them in the `To Do` column (this column reflects your plan of action for the next week, or sprint)
- Establish a schedule for team stand-up meetings. Ideally, these should be daily, but if team members can't make that schedule work, try to aim for at least twice a week. Add your schedule to the `teams` tab of our class metadata google doc (the link is on our syllabus page in Canvas). As you begin holding stand-ups, make sure to keep your GitHub project board up-to-date so meetings remain focused on relevant tasks/features for the current sprint.
