As members of a team, we often work in our own corners of the project code.

A designer may create HTML and CSS files to bring the "front end" to life, while a second team member focuses on writing Javascript to add data and interactivity to the page. A third teammate may write web scrapers in Python to acquire data and generate JSON for interactive visualizations.

Although each member on such a team often works on separate directories and files, it's important each person to stay up-to-date with the code produced by the rest of the team.  [Version control][] tools -- and git in particular -- are the secret ingredient that allow teams to _easily_ share, synchronize and integrate their code.

[Version control]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control

Such tools offer a variety of benefits:

* A way to easily incorporate the latest changes from teammates
* A history of changes
* The ability to "roll back" to prior versions of the code
* A mechanism for surfacing and resolving code conflicts

Today, we'll review how to use the Git version control system and GitHub for collaborative workflows. Here are some related resources:
