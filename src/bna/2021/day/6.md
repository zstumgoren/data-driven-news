## Reflecting on process

Agile teams often block out time to regularly reflect on their process, and to think of ways to improve their team's performance. In the industry slang, these are known as agile "retrospectives".

These meetings can occur at the end of a sprint, after certain project milestones are reached, or once a project is complete. Sometimes teams hold retrospectives at each of these stages.

Retrospective meetings are typically structured around three key questions:

* What went well?
* What could we improve?
* What are our next steps/action items?

For each of these questions, team members take time to post notes on a whiteboard (virtual or real) and then briefly discuss the points raised, before moving onto the next question.

The aim is to externalize successes and areas for potential improvement, and to end the meeting with a concrete plan of action. Just as agile teams build software iteratively, they reflect regularly with the hope of incrementally improving as a team over time.

This process is not so different than a sports team reviewing video of past games, analyzing their training methods, and assessing other variables that affect a team's success.

**This is not an exercise in self-criticism. It's an effort to identify a path toward peak performance.**

This type of reflection should not be a one-time event, but a regularly scheduled part of a team's routine.

Today, we'll do a group retrospective before breaking off into our groups for project work.
