Today, teams will present the latest iteration of their project designs.

You don't need to have "pixel perfect" mock-ups, but you should have some basic visual representation of the app, graphic or site that you're building. This can be pen-on-paper, a Figma or Illustrator mock-up, the beginnings of an actual prototype in HTML/CSS -- or some combination of all of the above.

During the presentation, each team should:

* Walk us through a visual representation of their final project that illustrates the core features and elements
* Explain any interactive elements
* Describe current status of implementation and next steps
* Note potential challenges to executing the design
