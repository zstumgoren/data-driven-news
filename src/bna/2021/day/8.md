## Code conflicts

Git is a sophisticated tool that often does the correct, or sensible, thing in a variety of contexts. In particular, it's very smart about merging code from one branch into another.

In many cases, the below will "just work":

```bash
# Merge dev branch into main
git checkout main
git merge dev
```

But there will be times when team members produce conflicting code changes. This often happens when two people modify the same area of a single file.

In such cases, git will warn of a [merge conflict][] when you try to merge branches, and will require you to manually resolve such a conflict before allowing the merge operation to complete.

This is a common and natural part of collaborative coding.

Today, we'll learn how merge conflicts arise and practice the process of resolving the issue.
