## Overview

As members of a team, we often work in our own corners of the project code.

A designer may create HTML and CSS files to bring the "front end" to life, while a second team member focuses on writing Javascript to add data and interactivity to the page. A third teammate may write web scrapers in Python to acquire data and generate JSON for interactive visualizations.

Although each member on such a team often works on separate directories and files, it's important for each person to stay up-to-date with the code produced by the rest of the team.  [Version control][] tools -- and git in particular -- are the secret ingredient that allow teams to _easily_ share, synchronize and integrate their code.

[Version control]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control

Such tools offer a variety of benefits:

* A way to easily incorporate the latest changes from teammates
* A history of changes
* The ability to "roll back" to prior versions of the code
* A mechanism for surfacing and resolving code conflicts

Today, we'll review how to use the Git version control system and GitHub for collaborative workflows.

## Resources

Here are some useful resources:

  * [Team Workflow with GitHub](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1ii6PBgxdyffeIoGvkKmxFh7iwfHMpBjl7uEacWMO15o/edit?usp=sharing) - the approach we recommend using for this class

## Code conflicts

Git is a sophisticated tool that often does the correct, or sensible, thing in a variety of contexts. In particular, it's very smart about merging code from one branch into another.

In many cases, the below will "just work":

```bash
# Merge dev branch into main
git checkout main
git merge dev
```

But there will be times when team members produce conflicting code changes. This often happens when two people modify the same area of a single file.

In such cases, git will warn of a [merge conflict][] when you try to merge branches, and will require you to manually resolve such a conflict before allowing the merge operation to complete.

[merge conflict]: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge#_how_conflicts_are_presented

This is a common and natural part of collaborative coding, and it's important to gain familiarity with the process for resolving merge conflicts.

Often, the *key* to resolving conflicts is communication with teammates. A quick Slack message or a few minutes of pair programming can help sort out which code changes should be kept and which discarded.
