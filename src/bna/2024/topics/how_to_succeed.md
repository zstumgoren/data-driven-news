If you're new(ish) to programming and web development, be prepared to invest quite a few hours as you level up on key skills. This is a good thing. The more reps you get in off-line, the more successful you’ll be in this class. That said, don’t beat your head on the keyboard for 8 hours just to discover a missing comma in your code.

If you've put in an honest effort, researched and tried various solutions, then it's probably time to reach out to a classmate or instructor for help. I call this the "15-minute" rule. It can be an incredibly effective strategy for punching through a problem.  Often, the simple act of [explaining the problem to someone](https://blog.adrianbolboaca.ro/2012/12/teddy-bear-pair-programming/) will reveal the solution.

Here are a few other suggestions and rules of the road for our course:

- *Release the fear and adopt a [growth mindset][].* Programming is a skill that anyone can learn. Put fear on time-out and trust that you too can do this.
- *Be kind.* We have a ZERO-tolerance policy on techtosterone. Both in and out of class, strive to create an environment where classmates feel comfortable asking any and all questions, reaching out for help, and offering suggestions. If you're steeped in a topic, share your knowledge. If you see someone struggling, help them or nudge them to ask for help.
- *Unleash your curiosity.* Be ambitious in your project ideas. Explore interesting technical nooks and crannies. Ask questions in or out of class. If we can’t answer them straight off, we can explore them together.
- *Collaborate.* We all bring different experiences and perspectives to our work. Share your experience and perspective and listen to the contributions of others as we tackle assignments and projects.
- *Prepare.* In order to collaborate with teammates and make a meaningful contribution on the class project, you must keep pace with your own learning goals. If you fall behind or get stuck, reach out for help!
- *Perspirate.* As with most things worth learning, programming takes work. Invest real time on assignments, follow your curiosity and challenge yourself to apply newfound skills in and out of class.
