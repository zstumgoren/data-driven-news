## Team roles

There are many specialties in the world of programming and data work. A "full-stack developer" is a rare thing, since it implies professional-level mastery of a wide range of skills:

* Server-side language(s) such as Python and/or NodeJs
* Data acquisition and analysis
* API usage and creation
* Datastores (e.g. relational databases and NoSQL)
* Cloud infrastructure to host a tool or app (e.g.
AWS)
* Interactive design *and* implementation using "front-end" code (HTML/CSS/JS)

Front-end work alone entails a head-spinning number of skills, as detailed in the [Front End Developer Handbook 2019][], which takes a skeptical view of the ["mythical" full-stack developer][].

## Areas of growth and mastery

This is not to discourage you from trying to learn many different skills. However, be pragmatic in how much you try to *master* at once. A good approach is to choose an area of growth and area of mastery. For example, let's say you have some basic Python programming skills and some basic HTML and CSS. An area of growth for you could be to begin learning Javascript to create dynamic web pages (e.g. dropdown menus and dynamic page elements that require calling out to APIs). Meanwhile, as an area of mastery, you may deepen your skills using Python to acquire data through web scraping and/or the use of APIs.

As you think about your SMART goals, try to identify roles or tasks that will allow you to grow new skills and deepen existing skills *while working toward your team goals*.

## SMART Goals

### Overview

So we have a basic sense of our users and some initial ideas on the types of software that we can build to address their needs.

Let's start pinning down some specific project "deliverables" by creating individual SMART goals. These goals should reflect the team's objective(s) as well as your plans for individual contributions to the team project.

Remember that SMART goals are:

* **S**pecific - This is your mission statement, and should reflect your contribution to the overall team project and your personal learning interests.
* **M**easurable - Provide a quantifiable way to measure if the goal has been reached.
* **A**chievable - Be ambitious but realistic. Create a stretch goal that will motivate you, but is not so difficult or complex that you feel overwhelmed. Sometimes it's difficult to know where to set the mark. Don't stress -- we'll take time throughout the quarter to reflect and adjust our goals.
* **R**elevant - Your goal should be aligned with both your own learning interests as well as your team's objectives (i.e. the beat and user stories you've defined).
* **T**ime-bound - You'll need a cut-off date for the goal (by the last week of class at the latest).

Below are some references on SMART goals if you need a refresher:

* [Essential Guide to Writing SMART Goals](https://www.smartsheet.com/blog/essential-guide-writing-smart-goals)
* [SMART Goals 101](https://www.briantracy.com/blog/personal-success/smart-goals/) 
* [SMART Goals: How to Make Your Goals Achievable](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm)

### Example

Here's an example of a SMART Goal:

> By the last week of the quarter, I will produce three different D3 data visualizations on the [Observable notebook platform](https://observablehq.com/) -- e.g. a map, bar chart and scatter plot --  that helps inform the public about the number of employees laid off in California during the COVID pandemic. These visualizations will provide content for my team's project website, which focuses on the economic impact of the pandemic, and will help develop my own ability to create bespoke, highly interactive data visualizations.


## Create your own SMART Roadmap

* Create a Google Doc based on this [SMART learning plan template][]
* Add me (zstumgoren at gmail.com) as an editor
* Below your SMART goal, draft an initial list of the key technical skills and technologies you expect to learn to execute your team goals

### Create an Action Plan

With our SMART goals defined and a general sense of our learning roadmap, we're ready to start fleshing out individualized learning plans that support our goals. Here are the key steps:

* For each high-level skill or technology we identified in the previous section, **identify specific resources you plan to study**. These can be videos, narrative tutorials, reverse-engineering an example of a similar project, experimenting on a small example to understand a key concept, etc.
* **Create a 1-week [sprint][] plan** that details the resources you plan to study. If the resource includes a large volume of material, you should figure out which sections you can realistically get through in one week.

[sprint]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Sprint

### Choose Passive and Active Tasks

As you identify learning resources, try to pick a variety that include instruction in fundamentals as well as resources or exercises that force you to practice specific skills.

Reading or watching tutorials are _passive_ activities. They can be useful, especially for providing ambient awareness of what's possible, but be sure to also include exercises or resources that _actively engage you in coding practice_.

Tutorials with example code that you type in as you follow along are OK. Much better are materials with exercises that ask you to practice what have you have learned.


### GitHubify Your Action Plan

We'll use our team [GitHub project management board](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/managing-project-boards) and [issues][] to flesh out and track our action items.

[issues]: https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/managing-your-work-with-issues

* On the team project, create a project management board. Select `Automated Kanban` for the project template.
* After creating the board, delete the default "cards" that appear in the columns after setting up the board.
* Add a `Backlog` column to the far left. This is a place for team members to drop items for a future [sprint][].

Any work that you plan to complete in the upcoming week should go in the `To Do` column.  Future work should go in `Backlog`.

> We'll use this new project board to plan our individual learning activities as well as tasks related to the team's project.

### An example walk-through

Let's say you're new to web development and have a SMART Goal of creating a page layout and search feature for a team site that allows users to explore layoffs in California during the pandemic.

Your study plan will likely involve learning some web fundamentals along with the basics of HTML, CSS and JS. A reasonable learning plan for the first weekly sprint might be to work through tutorials on HTML and CSS on CodeAcademy or W3Schools, along with some high-level background material such as:

* [How does the Internet work?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/How_does_the_Internet_work)
* [How the Web works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works)

Using your [project board "swimlanes"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board):

* Create issues for each learning task in the `To Do` column. For example you might have separate issues called _Work through the W3C tutorial on HTML_ and _Complete CodeAcademy lesson on HTML_. Each of those issues should have links (in the body of the ticket) to the relevant learning resource.
* Assign each issue to yourself
* Create a new 'label' called `learning` and assign it to all your new issues

### Tracking progress and communicating

As you work on learning tasks, move the issues from `To Do` to `In Progress` and `Done`.

Another way to track progess is by using [task lists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-task-lists) in the body of GitHub [issues][]. These can be especially helpful for tasks with lots of steps or a resource with multiple sections such as a tutorial.

Lastly, issues are helpful for storing important background information about a task and communicating with your instructor or teams (through comments). They provide a great way to centralize conversations and record decisions around specific tasks and resources.
