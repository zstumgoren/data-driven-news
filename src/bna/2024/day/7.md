## Wireframes Review

Today we'll present the first drafts of our site designs, aka [wireframes][]. This is the first of several design check-ins throughout the quarter.

Your wireframes should feature the following elements:

- Important page types (home page, child pages, etc)
- The features each page will have, along with site-wide elements such as navigation
- How users will interact with your site

> Important: Designs should *clearly* address your team's [user stories](../../topics/beats_and_user_stories/)
