## Design Reading Discussion

We'll kick off class with a dicussion of important design principles
mentioned in our latest [reading assignment](../../assignments/5/).

## Daily Stand-ups

Git and GitHub provide technical solutions to help teams work better. [Daily stand-ups](../../topics/daily_standup/) are a workflow practice that help teams *communicate* better. Today we'll briefly learn how a daily "stand-up", or scrum, can help us fire on all cylinders as a team and practice the technique as a group.  Each team will set up a scrum schedule and begin applying this workflow on a regular basis.
