## Wireframes Review

Today we'll present the first drafts of our site designs, aka [wireframes][]. This is the first of several design check-ins throughout the quarter.

Your wireframes should feature the following elements:

- Important page types (home page, child pages, etc)
- The features each page will have, along with site-wide elements such as navigation
- How users will interact with your site

> Important: Designs should *clearly* address your team's [user stories](../../topics/beats_and_user_stories/)

## Project Planning with Milestones

Daily stand-ups, or scrum, enable frequent communication about the status of work during a short period of time known as a "sprint".

But it's also helpful to draft a roadmap of the [milestones](../../topics/milestones/) we plan to accomplish on a longer timeline. Having a series of mid-way markers can help us think through multiple aspects of our work and devise a rough plan for what to build, and when to build it.

Today we'll review how to use GitHub milestones to plan future work and apply the methodology to our team projects.
