## Final presentations

Today we'll present the final versions of our projects. Presentations
should include the following elements:

* Refresher on the goals of your project
* A demo of the app or graphic, highlighting important story elements
  and interactive features
* Discuss the biggest challenges your team encountered and how you
worked through them.
* If you had another month, what else would you have added to the
project?

### Submission

Each person should submit the public URL to their final project via Canvas. If you're project is not public,
submit the GitHub URL for your project.

## Course retrospective

If time allows, we'll wrap up by reflecting on what you all have accomplished this quarter and how to continue learning about storytelling on the web.
