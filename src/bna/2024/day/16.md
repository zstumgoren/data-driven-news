In [part 1](../../day/15) of this exercise, we developed a big picture understanding of cloud services and how they can help us build a dynamic API, with the end goal of creating a data visualization that allows users to view unemployment data for their own county.

Today we'll continue that journey with a focus on importing data into [BigQuery][] and learning how to write SQL to select data points by county and state.

[BigQuery]: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs
