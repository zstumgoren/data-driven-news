## Git Finale

Today we'll take some time to review any questions from [Assignment 4 - Version Control with Git](../../assignments/4/).

We'll step back to better understand the recommended approaches for _how
to work_ with GitHub, both as a team as well as a sensible individual daily workflow.

We'll then wrap up our introduction to [team Collaboration with Git](../../topics/team_collab_with_git/) by diving into branches, merging code, and various snags you'll inevitably encounter when using version control (yes, I mean merge conflicts, among other annoyances).


## Project Design - Take 1

We'll also take some time to review basic design principles, and begin [wireframing][] our projects. This is the first of several design check-ins we'll be conducting throughout the quarter.

The goal is to begin sketching out the overall layout of your websites, with a focus on:

- Identifying important page types (home page, child pages, etc)
- The features each page will have, along with site-wide elements such as navigation
- How users will interact with your site

> Important: Designs should *clearly* address your team's [user stories](../../topics/beats_and_user_stories/)
