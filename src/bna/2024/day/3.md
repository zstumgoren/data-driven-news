## Team project presentations

Today, each team will present their project beats, user stories and initial ideas for software. This is an opportunity to refine ideas and user stories based on feedback from classmates. In addition, it's a chance for you to begin articulating the role each team member will play on the project.

Each team should present on the following:

* Project beat(s)
* User stories
* General software ideas to address the needs identified in user stories
* What role each team member plans to play

## SMART Roadmap feedback

If time allows and folks are ready, we'll also present the first draft of our [Smart Roadmaps](../../topics/smart_roadmap/). Here again, this is a chance to
get some initial feedback and lay out a concrete plan of study for the next few weeks, one that challenges you to learn new skills while contributing to your team's broader goals.

Once we have a solid plan, we'll flesh out our first weekly "learning" sprint on the team Project Board, as detailed in [GitHubify your Action Plan](../../topics/smart_roadmap/#githubify-your-action-plan).
