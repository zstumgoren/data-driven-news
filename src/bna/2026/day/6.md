## SMART Roadmap review

We'll begin class today with a quick review of your [SMART Roadmaps](../../assignments/smart_roadmap/).

## Wireframes feedback

We'll also check in on the status of your user stories and [wireframes](../../assignments/wireframes/). Remember, these should evolve based on feedback during our last class and as you develop a better sense of the data you'll have available for the project.


## Git Overview and Basics

Version control in general and git in partiuclar are widely used by data journalists and news apps teams.

But this tool can be tricky to learn. Today we'll get a big picture sense of why we use git, especially in a team context.

Then we'll dive into the basics of git syntax to set the stage for an assignment designed to help you build a solid grasp of this technology.
