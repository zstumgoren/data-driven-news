## Interactivity with D3

We'll continue leveling up on D3 today with a [hands-on tutorial](https://github.com/zstumgoren/executions-viz) that demonstrates some core skills: 

* Reading and wrangling data
* Creating a column chart with labels
* Adding an interactive tooltip

These basic skills should provide a roadmap for creating more interesting interactive graphics, for example as part of the [final project][] :)
