## Website demos

> The in-class presentation of your website will be factored into the overall grade for Project 1.

Today we'll present our completed portfolio websites. The presentation should include:

* A demo of the key features
* A discussion of what went well and what proved difficult
* Mention of features or design elements that were left on the cutting room floor (and why)
* Thoughts on how well the design hews to the 4 principles of [Design Thinking](/bna/2019/day/8/#design-thinking) and areas for future improvement

## Quakebot review

We'll review solutions to the [quakebot assignment](https://github.com/zstumgoren/quakebot-exercise), which involved writing a Jinja template to generate an automated story from USGS earthquake data.

## Assignments

> No new *graded* assignments. But please make sure you've worked through the basics of Javascript (see below for details).
