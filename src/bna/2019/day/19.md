##  Final project presentations

On the last day of class, we'll present our D3 interactive news graphics. The presentation should be about 5 minutes and include the following elements:

* Explanation of the story idea
* Review of your initial design sketches and explanation of how and why the final implementation differs, if at all
* Demo of the interactive graphic
* Discussion of technical challenges, what was left on the cutting room floor, and possible improvements given more time

Here's the full description of the [final project][].
