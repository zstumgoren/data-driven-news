## Overview

Today, we'll explore some key elements in mapping with D3. We'll touch on the foundational skills of acquiring and converting [geospatial files][] to different formats, and then focus on the elements of building a [choropleth map][] in D3. 

In class today, we'll dissect a [choropleth map of U.S. unemployment rates][] from the [D3.js Cookbook][].

> For our class review of map code, please clone the repo and fire up a test server to display the map:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:NickQiZhu/d3-cookbook-v2.git
cd d3-cookbook-v2/ 
python -m http.server
# Or if above doesn't work, try
# python3 -m http.server
```

Next, go to `http://localhost:8000/src/chapter12/choropleth.html`

This map illustrates some basic techniques for building a choropleth map. Mapping (in D3 or otherwise) is a big topic, so we've included links below to resources that can help you keep learning.

We'll devote any remaining class time to hands-on work for the [final project][].

## Acquiring geospatial data

Acquiring and converting geospatial data to a suitable format for use in D3 (or other mapping tools) is a critical skill.

There are many sources for geospatial files. Here's a list to get you started:

* [Census Tiger/Line Shapefiles][] are a great starting point for U.S. geospatial data. Census also offers [other geospatial formats][] such as KML and ESRI geodatabase files.
* [NaturalEarth][] is a public domain set of vector and raster maps that include features such as administrative boundaries (states, city locations, etc.).
* Academic institutions such as the [Stanford Geospatial Center][] offer training and data.
* Government agencies often provide base maps that include parcel boundaries and other useful geographic features (e.g. [Santa Clara County GIS Map Data][]).

> Check out the the Stanford Geospatial Center's [Spatial Data Resources][] for more links.

## Converting geospatial data

Once you've acquired data for a map, it's often necessary to convert the data to geojson or, better yet, topojson for use in a D3 map. The latter is a light-weight geospatial format that will improve the performance of the map visualization.

A popular command-line tool for converting geospatial data between formats is [ogr2ogr][], part of the [gdal][] library.

For Mac users, here are the steps for installing gdal and converting a Census shapefile to geojson:

* Install [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation)
* Use Homebrew to install gdal so we have access to ogr2ogr command-line tool: `brew install gdal`
* Download [Census TIGER/Line Block Group Shapefile][] for San Francisco County
 * Unzip the shapefile
 * cd into the unpacked directory
 * Convert .shp -> .geojson: 

```bash
ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON -t_srs crs:84 sfblockgroups.geojson tl_2010_06075_bg10.shp
```

## Mapping in D3

D3 shines in the area of mapping due to its use of underlying web technologies such as SVG. Mapping in D3 requires a grasp of SVG [Path][] elements and [transformations][] using [Groups][], as well as familiarity with general mapping concepts such as [projections][].

[projections]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection

Below are some resources for D3 mapping:

* [Data-to-viz choropleth maps][] - provides a step-by-step walk-through, along with details on other map types such as [bubble][], [cartogram][], [connection][] and [hexbin][]
* [Learning D3.js Mapping][] and [code](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learning-D3js-4-Mapping-Second-Edition)
  * [Using the Path element](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-d3js-5/9781787280175/6d65bd0f-fa2a-492a-85ee-ebae89edb4c0.xhtml)
  * [Grouping](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-d3js-5/9781787280175/74277475-a3ee-4d81-b8b0-ef4cd9df1910.xhtml)
  * [Foundation - creating your basic map](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-d3js-5/9781787280175/d0893561-ab28-495e-82a0-6f18bde61bf4.xhtml) - provides a straight-forward walk-through of the basics such as reading and understanding geojson data, bounding boxes, and setting scales
  * [Creating choropleths](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-d3js-5/9781787280175/330dad8d-cfb8-45cc-89e5-549ec0bb3a63.xhtml) - demonstrates how to color map shapes based on data
* [D3.js Cookbook][] and [code](https://github.com/NickQiZhu/d3-cookbook-v2)
  * [Project the US map](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/data-visualization-with/9781786468253/ch12s02.html) - covers basic map projection, introduces geojson and topojson, and demonstrates how to integrate a zoom feature
  * [Building a choropleth map](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/data-visualization-with/9781786468253/ch12s04.html) - demonstrates how to shade a U.S. map using unemployment data. The code nicely illustrates how to knit together geospatial data with a secondary data source.
* [Command-Line Cartography][] by Mike Bostock is a more advanced, 4-part tutorial that walks through the process of creating a thematic map of California. It provides detailed instructions on using a suite of command-line tools to wrangle Census geospatial files into a form suitable for a D3 thematic map. (*note: many of the Census links are now broken*).
