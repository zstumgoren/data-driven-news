## Read up on news apps

Read [News Apps Overview](../../topics/news_apps_overview/)

## Find a favorite news app

Choose your favorite example of a news application, tool, or interactive graphic. Try to select something that you personally find informative and engaging -- even exciting! -- and would be interested in learning how to build yourself. The goal here is to get a feel for the variety of ways to create online news experiences, and to channel that inspiration into your own project ideas. **Everyone will present their favorite project at our next class meeting.**

If you're hard pressed to find examples, check out the resources referenced on [News Apps Overview](../../topics/news_apps_overview/) or the past winners of the [ONA journalism][] and [Sigma Award][] competitions, focusing especially on the news apps and visualization categories.

[Sigma Award]: https://datajournalism.com/awards

[ONA journalism]: https://awards.journalists.org/awards/visual-digital-storytelling/

Don't just read the award write-ups. Check out the related app/tool and stories to get a real feel for the app or visualization.  Be prepared to present your favorite next class and to discuss the following questions:

* What particular features did you like most about the project? Why?
* What could be improved or done differently about the project?

> If you are unable to make next class, please write a short 500-word memo on the above and email me.
