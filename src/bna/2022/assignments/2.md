## Housekeeping

### Pick a team name!

As a group, select a name for your team. Feel free to have fun it with, but don't [bikeshed](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bikeshedding) ðŸ˜€. We want to pick a name and get cracking on our beats and user stories.

### Create a GitHub Project Repo

One person on the team should:

* Go to GitHub
* Create a new *private* project called **bna-team-name**
* Add your teammates and me (zstumgoren) as collaborators

### Create a team Slack channel

Using the same name as your GitHub project, create a slack channel in our class workspace.

## User-centric project ideas

> Read [User Stories with Examples and Templates][] for more background.

[User Stories with Examples and Templates]: https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories

Create a shared Google Doc for your team called `Project Beat and User Stories`.

Flesh out this document so that it has the following sections:

* **Project beat(s)** - it's fine to have more than one if you're unsure which direction to go.
* **User stories** for your project beat(s) using the `As role...` methodology.
* **General software ideas** to address the user needs identified in the previous step. This may be a single unified platform with a variety of features, or perhaps multiple distinct tools, apps or graphics. There's no right answer on this front. The key is to think through, as a team, how to use technology to help address your users' needs.

**To submit, generate a "shareable link" for the GDoc and submit it via Canvas.**

> At our next class, each group will present and discuss their beat, user stories and software ideas.

### Level up on SMART Goals

We'll craft SMART Goals next week that help align individual technical learning with the goals of each team project.

There are a ton of materials online about SMART Goals, but here are two that provide a decent overview. Please watch and read before arriving in class:

* Charles Duhigg [video overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpSOb5q1cRo) of SMART Goals
