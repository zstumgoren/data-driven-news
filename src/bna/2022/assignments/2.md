## Housekeeping

### Pick a team name!

As a group, select a name for your team. Feel free to have fun it with, but don't [bikeshed](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bikeshedding) ðŸ˜€. We want to pick a name and get cracking on our beats and user stories.

### Create a GitHub Project Repo

One person on the team should:

* Go to GitHub
* Create a new *private* project called **bna-team-name**
* Add your teammates and me (zstumgoren) as collaborators

### Create a team Slack channel

Using the same name as your GitHub project, create a slack channel in our class workspace.

## User-centric project ideas

> Read [User Stories with Examples and Templates][] for more background.

[User Stories with Examples and Templates]: https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories

Create a shared Google Doc for your team called `Project Beat and User Stories`.

Flesh out this document so that it has the following sections:

* **Project beat(s)** - it's fine to have more than one if you're unsure which direction to go.
* **User stories** for your project beat(s) using the `As role...` methodology.
* **General software ideas** to address the user needs identified in the previous step. This may be a single unified platform with a variety of features, or perhaps multiple distinct tools, apps or graphics. There's no right answer on this front. The key is to think through, as a team, how to use technology to help address your users' needs.

**To submit, generate a "shareable link" for the GDoc and submit it via Canvas.**

> At our next class, each group will present and discuss their beat, user stories and software ideas.

## Craft your SMART Roadmap

Review the below resources on SMART Goals, which we'll use to craft individualized plans for technical learning that align with our team goals.

* [A SMART Roadmap](../../topics/smart_roadmap/#smart-goals)
* Charles Duhigg [video overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpSOb5q1cRo) of SMART Goals
* [SMART Goals: How to Make Your Goals Achievable](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm)

After reviewing the above, craft a SMART Goal for yourself.

Next, flesh out a 10-week plan of study based on this [SMART learning plan template][]. The objective is to sketch out a concrete plan of action in terms of the learning resources you plan to study.

It's a good idea to interleave some hands-on "milestone" projects along the way that force you to apply the skills you're learning. This helps ensure you're learning actively rather than passively.

Finally, keep in mind that this roadmap is *malleable*. We'll revisit the roadmap many times throughout the quarter to ensure it aligns with your pace of learning and the broader goals of your team.
