## Team roles

There are many specialties in the world of programming and data work. A "full-stack developer" is a rare thing, since it implies professional-level mastery of a wide range of skills:

* Server-side language(s) such as Python and/or NodeJs
* Data acquisition and analysis
* API usage and creation
* Datastores (e.g. relational databases and NoSQL)
* Cloud infrastructure to host a tool or app (e.g.
AWS)
* Interactive design *and* implementation using "front-end" code (HTML/CSS/JS)

Front-end work alone entails a head-spinning number of skills, as detailed in the [Front End Developer Handbook 2019][], which takes a skeptical view of the ["mythical" full-stack developer][].

## Areas of growth and mastery

This is not to discourage you from trying to learn many different skills. However, be pragmatic in how much you try to *master* at once. A good approach is to choose an area of growth and area of mastery. For example, let's say you have some basic Python programming skills and some basic HTML and CSS. An area of growth for you could be to begin learning Javascript to create dynamic web pages (e.g. dropdown menus and dynamic page elements that require calling out to APIs). Meanwhile, as an area of mastery, you may deepen your skills using Python to acquire data through web scraping and/or the use of APIs.

As you think about your SMART goals, try to identify roles or tasks that will allow you to grow new skills and deepen existing skills *while working toward your team goals*.

## SMART Goals

### Overview

So we have a basic sense of our users and some initial ideas on the types of software that we can build to address their needs.

Let's start pinning down some specific project "deliverables" by creating individual SMART goals. These goals should reflect the team's objective(s) as well as your plans for individual contributions to the team project.

Remember that SMART goals are:

* **S**pecific - This is your mission statement, and should reflect your contribution to the overall team project and your personal learning interests.
* **M**easurable - Provide a quantifiable way to measure if the goal has been reached.
* **A**chievable - Be ambitious but realistic. Create a stretch goal that will motivate you, but is not so difficult or complex that you feel overwhelmed. Sometimes it's difficult to know where to set the mark. Don't stress -- we'll take time throughout the quarter to reflect and adjust our goals.
* **R**elevant - Your goal should be aligned with both your own learning interests as well as your team's objectives (i.e. the beat and user stories you've defined).
* **T**ime-bound - You'll need a cut-off date for the goal (by the last week of class at the latest).

Below are some references on SMART goals if you need a refresher:

### Example

Here's an example of a SMART Goal:

> By the last week of the quarter, I will produce three different D3 data visualizations on the [Observable notebook platform](https://observablehq.com/) -- e.g. a map, bar chart and scatter plot --  that helps inform the public about the number of employees laid off in California during the COVID pandemic. These visualizations will provide content for my team's project website, which focuses on the economic impact of the pandemic, and will help develop my own ability to create bespoke, highly interactive data visualizations.

## A word on project scope

It's quite possible that your team will decide that several types of tools, apps or graphics are required to address the user needs you've identified. That's perfectly fine. The goal is to identify a beat and user stories that allow you to make a meaningful contribution to a major project, one that is challenging enough to keep you learning and building for the next two months.
