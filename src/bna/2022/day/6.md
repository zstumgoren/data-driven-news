## Daily Stand-ups

Git and GitHub provide technical solutions to help teams work better. [Daily stand-ups](../../topics/daily_standup/) are a workflow practice that help teams *communicate* better. Today we'll briefly learn how a daily "stand-up", or scrum, can help us fire on all cylinders as a team and practice the technique as a group.  Each team will set up a scrum schedule and begin applying this workflow on a regular basis.

## Project Planning with Milestones

Daily stand-ups, or scrum, enable frequent communication about the status of work during a short period of time known as a "sprint".

But it's also helpful to draft a roadmap of the [milestones](../../topics/milestones/) we plan to accomplish on a longer timeline. Having a series of mid-way markers can help us think through multiple aspects of our work and devise a rough plan for what to build, and when to build it.

Today we'll review how Big Local News uses GitHub milestones to plan some of its work, and then apply a similar methodology to our own team projects.
