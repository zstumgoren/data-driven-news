## Overview

Today, we'll review various ways to [get your projects on the web](../../topics/getting_on_the_web/). After this high-level overview, we'll walk through the process of creating a new GitHub organization to host our team project site on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

We'll then begin integrating our work on this new site. Along the way, we'll put into practice the git skills we practiced [last class](../13/), and go through a few rounds of the standard workflow:

- Pushing work to branches
- Creating and approving Pull Requests
- Merging our teammates' code into our active local branches
