## Overview

Today, we'll create a single git repository to serve as the final home for our projects and begin integrating our work. We'll put into practice the git skills we practiced [last class](../13/), and go through a few rounds of the standard workflow:

- Pushing work to branches
- Creating and approving Pull Requests
- Merging our teammates' code into our active local branches.
