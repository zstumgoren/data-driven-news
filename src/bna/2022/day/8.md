## Overview

We'll devote today's class to [Javascript Tinkering (Assignment 7)](../../assignments/7/). Remember, the goal is to pick a Javascript technique that you'd like to learn or master, ideally one that will be useful for your team project. We'll work together to strip away the inessentials so we can focus on gaining a better handle on the core concepts behind the techniques we're exploring.
