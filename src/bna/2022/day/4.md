## How to Learn Coding

With our [Smart Roadmaps](../../topics/smart_roadmap/) fleshed out, let's spend a few minutes reviewing *how* to approach our individual technical learning. We'll discuss your own ideas -- what's worked well and not so well in the past -- and talk through [10 Tips for Learning Code](../../topics/ten_tips_for_learning_code/).

Version control in general and git in partiuclar are widely used by data journalists and news apps teams.
