Today we'll take some time to review any questions from [Assignment 3 - Version Control with Git](../../assignments/3/).

We'll then wrap up our introduction to [team Collaboration with Git](../../topics/team_collab_with_git/) by diving into branches, merging code, and various snags you'll inevitably encounter when using version control (yes, I mean merge conflicts, among other annoyances).
