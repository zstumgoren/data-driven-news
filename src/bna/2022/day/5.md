## Git Finale

Today we'll take some time to review any questions from [Assignment 3 - Version Control with Git](../../assignments/3/).

We'll then wrap up our introduction to [team Collaboration with Git](../../topics/team_collab_with_git/) by diving into branches, merging code, and various snags you'll inevitably encounter when using version control (yes, I mean merge conflicts, among other annoyances).


## Daily Stand-ups

Git and GitHub provide technical solutions to help teams work better. [Daily stand-ups](../../topics/daily_standup/) are a workflow practice that help teams *communicate* better. Today we'll briefly learn how a daily "stand-up", or scrum, can help us fire on all cylinders as a team and practice the technique as a group.  Each team will set up a scrum schedule and begin applying this workflow on a regular basis.
