## Overview

Today, we'll learn how to build our own custom API using Google Cloud Platform. The goal will be to demonstrate how we can use cloud functions to add a bit of dynamic behavior to an otherwise static web interactive.

The API we build will use a [Cloud Function](https://cloud.google.com/functions/) to query BLS unemployment data stored on [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/).

Sample code lives [here](https://github.com/zstumgoren/bls-api/tree/main/open).
