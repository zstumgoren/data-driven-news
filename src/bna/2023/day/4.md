## SMART Roadmap feedback

We'll kick off class by presenting the first drafts of our [Smart Roadmaps](../../topics/smart_roadmap/). This is a chance to
get some initial feedback and lay out a concrete plan of study for the next few weeks, one that challenges you to learn new skills while contributing to your team's broader goals.

Once we have a solid plan, we'll flesh out our first weekly "learning" sprint on the team Project Board, as detailed in [GitHubify your Action Plan](../../topics/smart_roadmap/#githubify-your-action-plan).


## How to Learn Coding

With our [Smart Roadmaps](../../topics/smart_roadmap/) fleshed out, let's spend a few minutes reviewing *how* to approach our individual technical learning. We'll discuss your own ideas -- what's worked well and not so well in the past -- and talk through [10 Tips for Learning Code](../../topics/ten_tips_for_learning_code/).


## Git Overview and Basics

Version control in general and git in partiuclar are widely used by data journalists and news apps teams.

But this tool can be tricky to learn. Today we'll get a big picture sense of why we use git, especially in a team context.

Then we'll dive into the basics of git syntax to set the stage for an assignment designed to help you build a solid grasp of this technology.
