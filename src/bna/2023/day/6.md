## Daily Stand-ups

Git and GitHub provide technical solutions to help teams work better. [Daily stand-ups](../../topics/daily_standup/) are a workflow practice that help teams *communicate* better. Today we'll briefly learn how a daily "stand-up", or scrum, can help us fire on all cylinders as a team and practice the technique as a group.  Each team will set up a scrum schedule and begin applying this workflow on a regular basis.

## Project Planning with Milestones

Daily stand-ups, or scrum, enable frequent communication about the status of work during a short period of time known as a "sprint".

But it's also helpful to draft a roadmap of the [milestones](../../topics/milestones/) we plan to accomplish on a longer timeline. Having a series of mid-way markers can help us think through multiple aspects of our work and devise a rough plan for what to build, and when to build it.

Today we'll review how to use GitHub milestones to plan future work and apply the methodology to our team projects.
