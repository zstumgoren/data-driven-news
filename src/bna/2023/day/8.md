## Overview

Today we'll review how [browser developer tools can serve as a dashboard](../../topics/coding_cockpit/) for gaining visibility into our code. We'll also try to get a better feel for how to use Javascript to *dynamically* modify a web page after it has loaded in the browser (i.e. manipulating the DOM).

## Assignments

* [Assignment 7 - DOM and Browser Tools](../../assignments/7/)
* [Assignment 8 - Javascript Tinkering](../../assignments/8/)
