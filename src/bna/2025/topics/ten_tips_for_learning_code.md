## 1. Lay the foundation

It's tempting to skip fundamentals and immediately start coding on your project, especially with the universe of open code on platforms such as Glitch.com and [ObservableHQ][]. And of course, ChatGPT and the like are supposed to free us from the burden of ever writing code, right? Wrong!

These powerful tools can certainly jump-start projects and save you a great deal of time, but using them effectively -- ie without mountains of wasted hours and frustration -- still requires a solid grasp of web fundamentals. That includes a basic understanding of syntax, debugging techniques and how disparate parts of a project and varying technologies fit together.

If you're just starting out with web coding, you should take at least 3-4 weeks to level up on the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and Javascript before attempting to use more sophisticated tools such as d3 or React.

## 2. Choose something and  try it

The sheer number of online resources for technical learning can be overwhelming. It's fine to do some initial research on learning materials. Our class [list of coding resources][] can help on that front. Just don't get bogged down on the research phase. 

Pick a tutorial, course, etc. and give it a try. If it's not working for you, _then_ consider an alternative.

## 3. Time-boxed, targeted ramp-up

Balance the need to learn with the need to execute.

Give yourself some time to [ramp up on new skills](#1.-lay-the-foundation), but avoid the rabbit hole of learning every nook and cranny of a new technology. Focus your learning on skills that support the team project.

## 4. Practice deliberately

Don't dive into a complex project and immediately try to apply a wide range of languages and tools that you've never used before. It's a recipe for frustration.

Learn, practice and apply new skills iteratively:

* Identify key skills you'll need for a specific aspect of the project
* [Study and practice](#8.-learn-actively) those resources and exercises _outside the context of your project_
* Return to the project and try to apply those skills
* Rinse and repeat

## 5. Sip from the fountain, don't guzzle the fire hose

If you're new to coding for the web, don't try to learn HTML, CSS, JS, a new code editor, version control, etc. all at once. That's a recipe for frustration and "overwhelm."

Focus on one skill at a time to [lay a solid foundation](#1.-lay-the-foundation) for more advanced work.

## 6. Learn by remixing

Adapting the work of others can jumpstart your project and provide a window into how the "pros" execute real-world projects. Platforms such as Glitch.com and [ObservableHQ][] make it especially easy to [fork](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/fork-share-merge?collection=@observablehq/editing-publishing-collaborating) or [remix](https://help.glitch.com/kb/article/23-what%E2%80%99s-remix/) -- aka copy and customize -- other people's work.

Just make sure to [cover your fundamentals](#1.-lay-the-foundation) and _understand the code_ before remixing. Otherwise you're just [copy-paste programming][].

## 7. Reverse-engineer, then transfer the learning

Find an existing project similar to what you're trying to build. Pick apart the code to understand how it works, with an eye toward identifying the tools and techniques that were used and why they were used. This is an area where tools such as ChatGPT can really send your learning into over-drive. As you explore other people's code bases, I encourage you to use ChatGPT to help explain what the code is doing if it's at all unclear.

The reverse-engineering process is most effective when you combine [study and experimentation](#8.-learn-actively). Determine which tools and techniques might be useful in your project. Then try applying them in small-scale, novel ways. It's much easier to adapt a technique for your own project once you have a solid understanding of it.

[Remixing](#6.-learn-by-remixing) is a great way to get started with reverse-engineering.

> This strategy for learning (and coding) is the opposite of [cargo cult][] or [copy-paste programming][].

## 8. Learn actively

Books, tutorials and videos can help convey the fundamentals of coding and how different skills fit together.

Many help build coding "muscle memory" by asking you to type commands along the way. But even these resources involve _passive_ learning. You're essentially following a script.

When working on a tutorial, make time to experiment and _play_ with new syntax and techniques. Tinkering in a [simplified, unguided context](#4.-practice-deliberately) helps internalize new skills.

## 9. Make code a daily habit

Devote a bit of time each day to [study and practice](#8.-learn-actively). This time should be dedicated to _learning_, not executing your project.

Thirty minutes of focused, daily practice will burn syntax and techniques into your brain more effectively than one or two late-night marathons of hacking per week.

## 10. Reflect

We often race from one task to the next as we learn new skills. Before rushing to the next item on your checklist, take a few minutes to reflect on what you just learned. This practice will help ingrain new material, expose knowledge gaps, and illuminate the path for further study.

Use the last few minutes of your study time to recall and write about what you learned. Or, start your next study session with a bit of reflection.

Some questions to consider:

* What is the role of this new technique or skill in a coding context?
* How does it relate to other skills or techniques I'm learning?
* Are there aspects of the skill I struggled with?
* What else should I study to better understand or apply this skill?
