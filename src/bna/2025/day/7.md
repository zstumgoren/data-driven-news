Today we'll continue our git and GitHub journey through some hands-on
work intended to:

- Build "muscle memory" with git command-line commands
- Gain comfort with branches, pull requests, and merges
- Help visualize the lifecycle of the git/GitHub workflow in a team
context

Check out [Team Collaboration with Git](../../topics/team_collab_with_git/) for more on this topic.
