## Wireframes feedback

We'll start class today with a review of your [wireframes](../../assignments/wireframes/).


## GitHub Milestones

We'll briefly review the concept of [GitHub Milestones](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/about-milestones) and how they can help you plan and track your project work.


## Git Overview and Basics

Version control in general and git in partiuclar are widely used by data journalists and news apps teams.

But this tool can be tricky to learn. Today we'll get a big picture sense of why we use git, especially in a team context.

Then we'll dive into the basics of git syntax to set the stage for an assignment designed to help you build a solid grasp of this technology.
