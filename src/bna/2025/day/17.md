In [part 2](../../day/16) of this exercise, we learned how to work with [BigQuery][] to query unemployment data by county and state.

Today we'll complete the process by crafting a [Cloud Function][] API that can dynamically query BigQuery for unemployment stats based on user input from our Vega-Lite chart (via web form submission).

We'll then spend the remainder of class brainstorming and implementing [ideas to improve the chart](https://github.com/zstumgoren/bls-api/blob/main/docs/exercises.md) (which is admittedly quite basic).
