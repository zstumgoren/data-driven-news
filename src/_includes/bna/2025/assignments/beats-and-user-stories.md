## Housekeeping

### Pick a team name!

As a group, select a name for your team. Feel free to have fun with it, but don't [bikeshed][] ðŸ˜€. We want to pick a name and get cracking on our beats and user stories.

### Create a GitHub Project Repo

One person on the team should:

* Go to GitHub
* Create a new *private* project called **bna-team-name**
* Add your teammates and me (zstumgoren) as collaborators on the repo

### Create a team Slack channel

Using the same name as your GitHub project, create a Slack channel in our class workspace.

## User-centric project ideas

Create a shared Google Doc for your team called `Project Beat and User Stories`.

Flesh out this document so that it has the following sections:

* **Project beat(s)** - it's fine to have more than one if you're unsure which direction to go.
* **User stories** for your project beat(s) using the `As role...` methodology.
* **General software ideas** to address the user needs identified in the previous step. This may be a single unified platform with a variety of features, or perhaps multiple distinct tools, apps or graphics. There's no right answer on this front. The key is to think through, as a team, how to use technology to help address your users' needs.

**To submit, generate a "shareable link" for the GDoc and submit it via Canvas.**

> At our next class, each group will present and discuss their beat, user stories and software ideas.
