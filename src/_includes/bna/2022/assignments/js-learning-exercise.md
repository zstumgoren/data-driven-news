### Javascript learning exercise

Pick a Javascript language feature or technique that you're curious about but have not yet mastered, and create a code example that demonstrates how to use the feature.

> Before commencing work, you must clear the feature or technique with me. 

For this assignment, create a private Github repo called `stanford-bna-js-tinker`. **You must add me as a collaborator and submit a link to the repo via Canvas.** 

The repo should contain:

* An HTML file that references external Javascript file(s)
* One or more JS files (again, referenced from the HTML)
* If relevant, CSS in an external file or embedded in the HTML in a `style` tag
* A `README.md` memo of no more than 500 words. The memo should include the following info:
  * What skill you set out to learn.
  * How you went about learning it (e.g. links to specific tutorials, StackOverflow posts, code tinkering you performed, usage of the Developer Toolbar, etc.). You're encouraged to embed code snippets in the `README.md` (here's how to [embed code in Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code)).
  * Assessment of your degree of mastery. How much do you feel you have learned? Do you think you could code this technique from memory in the future? Could you explain/teach it to someone else?

#### Important notes

The skill you dig into must be something beyond basic language features. For example, writing a "for" loop or creating a conditional, variable or function are *not* acceptable subjects for this assignment.

However, more advanced language features or concepts are fair game. For example, demonstrating an understanding of variable scoping rules, closures, Javascript modules and prototypal inheritance, would all be acceptable. 

That said, I would encourage you to **focus on *practical, task-oriented* skill-building**. Examples include:

* How to dynamically construct an HTML table from JSON data.
* How to dynamically style a nav bar using JS click events and modification of CSS properties.
* How to build a web form that can make a JSON API call without triggering a page reload.

Use your recent website work as inspiration for ideas. Was there a feature you had to drop because you didn't quite understand how to implement it in Javascript?

If you're still hard pressed for ideas, check out the [Intermediate Use Cases][] from the Mozilla Developer Network. 

> But again, you must ping me ahead of time for approval of the idea.
