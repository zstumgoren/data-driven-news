Read up or refresh on the critical concept of the [Document Object Model][], and start learning how to use the browser's built-in developer tools.

[Document Object Model]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model

Review the below resources on the DOM and Browser Developer Tools:

- [W3Schools Javascript HTML DOM](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp) - a brief crash course on the DOM and how Javascript can be used to manipulate it.
- [What are browser Developer Tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools)

Then work through the following:

* Create a public GitHub repo called `bna-dom-practice`
* Read and work through the exercises in the MDN [Manipulating Documents](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents). **Stop just before** _Active learning: A dynamic shopping list_. 
* Commit the code to your repo and push to GitHub
* Submit the URL to the repo via Canvas
