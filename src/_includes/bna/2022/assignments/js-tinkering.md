## Javascript Tinkering

Pick a Javascript language feature or technique that you're curious about but have not yet mastered, and create a code example that demonstrates how to use the feature.

> Before commencing work, you must clear the feature or technique with me.

For this assignment, create a private Github repo called `stanford-bna-js-tinker`.

**To complete the assignment, add me as a collaborator on the repo and submit a link to the repo via Canvas.**

The repo should contain:

* An HTML file that references external Javascript file(s)
* One or more JS files (again, referenced from the HTML)
* If relevant, CSS in an external file or embedded in the HTML in a `style` tag
* A `README.md` memo briefly describing:
  * *What skill you set out to learn.*
  * *How you went about learning it.* For example: links to specific tutorials, StackOverflow posts, code tinkering you performed, usage of the Developer Toolbar, etc. You're encouraged to embed code snippets in the `README.md` (here's how to [embed code in Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code)).
  * *Assessment of your degree of mastery.* How well do you feel you have learned the technique? For example, could you code this technique again from memory or with minimal reference to documentation? Could you explain or teach it to someone else? If you don't feel like you've fully mastered the technique, what would be your next step(s) to deepen your understanding?

#### Important notes

The skill you dig into must be something beyond basic language features. For example, writing a "for" loop or creating a conditional, variable or function are *not* acceptable subjects for this assignment.

However, more advanced language features or concepts are fair game if you're eager to gain deeper mastery of the language. For example, demonstrating an understanding of variable scoping rules, closures, Javascript modules or prototypal inheritance, would all be acceptable.

That said, I would encourage you to **focus on *practical, task-oriented* skill-building**. Examples include:

* How to dynamically construct an HTML table from JSON data.
* How to dynamically style a nav bar using JS click events and modification of CSS properties.
* How to build a web form that can make a JSON API call without triggering a page reload.

If you're hard pressed for ideas, choose something relevant to your team project. Is there a feature you're planning but don't yet know how to build (e.g. a dynamic search that helps users navigate to pages deeper in the website)?

Another alternative for potential tinkering ideas are the [Intermediate Use Cases][] from the Mozilla Developer Network.

> But again, you must ping me ahead of time for approval of the idea.
