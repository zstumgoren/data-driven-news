## Craft your SMART Roadmap

Review the below resources on SMART Goals, which we'll use to craft individualized plans for technical learning that align with our team goals.

* [A SMART Roadmap](../../topics/smart_roadmap/#smart-goals)
* Charles Duhigg [video overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpSOb5q1cRo) of SMART Goals
* [SMART Goals: How to Make Your Goals Achievable](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm)

After reviewing the above, craft a SMART Goal for yourself.

Next, flesh out a 10-week plan of study based on this [SMART learning plan template][]. The objective is to sketch out a concrete plan of action in terms of the learning resources you plan to study.

It's a good idea to interleave some hands-on "milestone" projects along the way that force you to apply the skills you're learning. This helps ensure you're learning actively rather than passively.

Finally, keep in mind that this roadmap is *malleable*. We'll revisit the roadmap many times throughout the quarter to ensure it aligns with your pace of learning and the broader goals of your team.
