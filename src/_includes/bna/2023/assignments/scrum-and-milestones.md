This is a two-part assignment:

- Team members should find a time outside of class to hold ["stand-up"](../../topics/daily_standup/), or scrum, meetings. Aim for at least twice a week, although a daily check-in is ideal. Place your schedule at the top of the `README.md` file in your team's GitHub repo.
- Update your team's GitHub board with [milestones](../../topics/milestones/) for all remaining weeks of the quarter. Each milestone should include a description of the overall goal for the week. Team members should assign Issues to the appropriate milestone. At the end of this process, most issues on your project board should be linked with a milestone, and all team members should have some issues to work on for each milestone.

Submit this assignment by providing the link to your repo via Canvas.
