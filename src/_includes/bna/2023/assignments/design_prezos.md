Each team should have a solid sense of project deliverables and a rough sketch of the final project at this point in the quarter.

We don't expect "pixel perfect" mock-ups, but you should have some basic visual representation of the app, graphic or site that you're building. This can be pen-on-paper, a Figma or Illustrator mock-up, the beginnings of an actual prototype in HTML/CSS -- or some combination of all of the above.

> It's important that the visual representation reflect your team's current plans. Please update your wireframes if the project has evolved since you last shared details with the class.

During next class, teams will present the latest iteration of their project designs. Each team should be prepared to:

* Walk us through a visual representation of their final project that illustrates the core features and elements
* Explain any interactive elements
* Describe current status of implementation and next steps
* Note potential challenges to executing the design
