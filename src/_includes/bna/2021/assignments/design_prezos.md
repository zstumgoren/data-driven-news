Each team should have a solid sense of project deliverables and at least a rough sketch of the final project at this point in the quarter.

We don't expect you to have "pixel perfect" mock-ups, but you should have some basic visual representation of the app, graphic or site that you're building. This can be pen-on-paper, a Figma or Illustrator mock-up, the beginnings of an actual prototype in HTML/CSS -- or some combination of all of the above.

> It's important that the visual representation reflect the most current plans. If your project has evolved since your initial designs, make sure to update any sketches or mock-ups to reflect the current state of affairs.

During next class, teams will present the latest iteration of their project designs. Each team should be prepared to:

* Walk us through a visual representation of their final project that illustrates the core features and elements
* Explain any interactive elements
* Describe current status of implementation and next steps
* Note potential challenges to executing the design
