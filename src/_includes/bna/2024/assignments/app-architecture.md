Create a Google Drawing that shows your site or tool's overall application architecture.

The diagram is intended as a high-level visual representation of the moving parts involved in your application, from source data inputs to final application.

The visual representations can be simple (squares, ovals, circles, arrows, etc.), and should include *brief* text annotations explaining important aspects in the design.

For example, an oval representing your application should include a note explaining which web platform the app uses (e.g. GitHub Pages).

When creating your design, important elements to include are:

- Data sources and how they will be acquired (including any manual steps)
- Important data preparation processes for the application (e.g. converting CSV to JSON), noting whether they are manually triggered, one-time or repeated operations, and any automation involved (e.g. using GitHub Actions)
- Site location and underlying dependencies.
  - platform (e.g. GitHub Pages, Vercel, etc.)
  - 3rd party APIs
